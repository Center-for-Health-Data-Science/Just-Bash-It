## Introduction

This document contains the hands-on `presentations` for the introductory
workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`. It is meant to
aid workshop teachers to recall what to show course participants in the
code along session. Each section in the slides-show is followed by a
‘cheat sheet’ containing the commands used in each of the sections
below. The ‘cheat sheet’ is intended for participants to look at and
recall bash commands used in a given session.

The `Just Bash It` workshop is developed and hosted by Center for Health
Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences
([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University
Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.

# Just Bash It!

This GitHub repository countains course materials for the introductory workshop to command line use and bash syntax for health researchers, with the running title: _Just Bash It!_

This two day workshop is targeted at biomedical and health researchers at the University of Copenhagen with no prior experience in bash command line use. It consists of a slideshow, hands-on presentations, code-along and accompanying exercises.    

The repo is created by Center for Health Data Science ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)) who also hold the workshop in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.

Workshop participants, please help us to improve the course by filling out our [feedback form](https://forms.office.com/r/nCsvsRFsAU)!

## Introduction

This document contains the hands-on `presentations` for the introductory workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`. It is meant to aid workshop teachers to recall what to show course participants in the code along session. 
Each section in the slides-show is followed by a 'cheat sheet' containing the commands used in each of the sections below. The 'cheat sheet' is intended for participants to look at and recall bash commands used in a given session.

The `Just Bash It` workshop is developed and hosted by Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.

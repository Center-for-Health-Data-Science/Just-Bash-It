## Introduction

This document contains the hands-on `presentations` for the introductory workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`. It is meant to aid workshop teachers to recall what to show course participants in the code along session. 
Each section in the slides-show is followed by a 'cheat sheet' containing the commands used in each of the sections below. The 'cheat sheet' is intended for participants to look at and recall bash commands used in a given session.

The `Just Bash It` workshop is developed and hosted by Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.   



## Presentation 1: Navigating Files and Directories

```{bash, engine="sh"}
pwd
```


## Presentation 2: Project Organization

In this section we show participants how to set up a good directory structure.

At the root under home/user the show the directory `projects` which contains the project at hand, it should be named `Just_Bash_It`. Reiterate commands `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
cd
pwd
ls
```

Move around the directories in the directory `Just_Bash_It`. Make a folder which is missing, show `mkdir` and add a `Readme` files to the dir using `touch`. Also reiterate `rm` if you make a mistake.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
mkdir
touch
rm
```

Go to the raw data folder and use `ls` and `du` options to show file sizes and file permission settings. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
ls -l *
ls -al *
ls -lh *

ls -l filename 
ls -al dir

du -sh
du -sh filename
du -sh dir
```

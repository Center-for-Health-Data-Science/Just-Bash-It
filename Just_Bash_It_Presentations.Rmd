## Introduction

This document contains the hands-on `presentations` for the introductory workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`. It is meant to aid workshop teachers to recall what to show course participants in the code along session.   
Each section in the slides-show is followed by a **cheat sheet** containing the commands used in each of the sections below. The **cheat sheet** is intended for participants to look at and recall bash commands used in a given session.

The `Just Bash It` workshop is developed and hosted by Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.   



## Presentation 1: Navigating Files and Directories

```{bash, engine="sh"}
pwd
```


## Presentation 2: Project Organization

In this section we show participants how to set up a good directory structure. TWorkshop teachers should have setup a directory structure like the one shown on slide 15.

1. Under home/user/(Desktop | Documents) show the directory `projects` which contains the project at hand. Reiterate commands `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
cd
pwd
ls
```

2. Move around the subdirectories in the directory `Just_Bash_It`. Make a folder which is missing, show `mkdir` and add a `readme` file to the dir using `touch`. Also make a mistake and reiterate `rm`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
mkdir
touch
rm
```

3. Go to the raw data folder and use `ls` and `du` options to show file sizes and file permission settings. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
ls -l *
ls -al *
ls -lh *

ls -l filename 
ls -al dir

du -sh
du -sh filename
du -sh dir
```


## Presentation 3: Working with Files and Directories

1. View the content of a file with different commands. Use a readme file from a github repo as an example. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
cat 
less
head -n
tail -n
```

2. Show editors: `nano, vim and emacs`. Edit a `readme` file made under the project structure. Add a line of text with each editor and show and option or two. Save the changes quit and use less to view it.

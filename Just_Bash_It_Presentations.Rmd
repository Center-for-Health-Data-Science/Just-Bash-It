## Introduction

This document contains the hands-on `presentations` for the introductory workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`. It is meant to aid workshop teachers to recall what to show course participants in the code along session.   
Each section in the slides-show is followed by a **cheat sheet** containing the commands used in each of the sections below. The **cheat sheet** is intended for participants to look at and recall bash commands used in a given session.

The `Just Bash It` workshop is developed and hosted by Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.   



## Presentation 1: Navigating Files and Directories

In this section we introduce the directory tree and show how to move around, list files and directories and what paths are.

Generally, whenever a command is written on a slide, you should demonstrate it. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
pwd
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}

ls 

ls -F

ls -lht

ls *

```

```{bash,  eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}

cd

```

```{bash,  eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}

man ls

ls --help

```


## Presentation 2: Project Organization

In this section we show participants how to set up a good directory structure. Workshop teachers should have setup a directory structure like the one shown on slide 15.

1. Under home/user/(Desktop | Documents) show the directory `projects` which contains the project at hand. Reiterate commands `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
cd
pwd
ls
```

2. Move around the subdirectories in the directory `Just_Bash_It`. Make a folder which is missing, show `mkdir` and add a `readme` file to the dir using `touch`. Also make a mistake and reiterate `rm`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
mkdir
touch
rm
```

3. Go to the raw data folder and use `ls` and `du` options to show file sizes and file permission settings. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
ls -l *
ls -al *
ls -lh *

ls -l filename 
ls -al dir

du -sh
du -sh filename
du -sh dir
```


## Presentation 3: Working with Files and Directories

1. View the content of a file with different commands. Use a readme file from a github repo as an example. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
cat 
less
head -n
tail -n
```

2. Show editors: `nano, vim and emacs`. Edit a `readme` file made under the project structure. Add a line of text with each editor and show and option or two. Save the changes quit and use less to view it.


## Presentation 4: More Bash Commands






## Presentation 5: Redirection & Pipes

1. Show how to use the pipe to combine `wc` and `sort`. 

2. Show some other chained commands as illustrated on slide 'chaining commands'.

## Presentation 6: Editors and Shell scripts 

1. Open a simple text editor (I use gedit. On windows perhaps use notepad?) and write a script. Save it. Show it has appeared with ls. View it with less or head. Check permissions. Change permissions to make it executable if necessary. Run it. 

## Presentation 7: Software Installation, Upkeep & More

## Presentation 8: Loops and Workflow Language 

1. In the script you have made during presentation 6 or a new one, write a bash loop. Print something like the file name in each iteration of the loop so you can demonstrate that it works when you run it. Perhaps we can run the loop on the RNAseq data. I guess one thing we could do in the loop would be to run `gunzip -c` and stream the first 12 lines to the display to check that they are all okay fastq files.

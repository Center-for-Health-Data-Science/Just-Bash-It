## Introduction

This markdown document contains of exercises for the introductory workshop on command line use, entitled `Just Bash It`, developed and hosted by Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences ([HeaDS](https://heads.ku.dk/)), in collaboration with the University Library ([KUB](https://kub.kb.dk/datalab)) Data Lab.   
This one day workshop is targeted at biomedical and health researchers at the University of Copenhagen with no prior experience in bash command line use.   

The workshop consists of a slideshow with slides to each section, in addition to hands-on presentations (code-along) and accompanying exercises. 


## Exercise 1: Navigating Files and Directories


## Exercise 2: Project Organization

Let's get structured!   

1. Make a `projects` directory at `/home/user/Desktop` on your computer with all the sub-folders shown on **slide 15** in the slideshow. You are free to name the project within the  `projects` folder whatever you would like, e.g. `Just_Bash_It, Intro_to_command_line, First_Project, ...`. **Cheat Sheet 1** in the slideshow will have the commands you need. 

You should have downloaded the course materials including the raw data files to you computer somewhere, maybe it is in your downloads folder or maybe you moved it somewhere else. 

2. Using the command-line, navigate to where you downloaded the course materials and copy or move the files in the new directory you have made and place it in the correct sub-folder.

3. Make a file called `readme` in your project.

4. How large are the data files you copied from the course materials?

5. Check the permissions of the data files you copied from the course materials. Do you have permission to `read`, `write` and `execute` them? If you are not allowed to execute the, what is the reason for this?


## Exercise 3: Working with Files and Directories


## Exercise 4: Commands, Redirection & Pipes


## Exercise 5: Advanced Commands


## Exercise 6: Editors and Shell scripts 


## Exercise 7: Loops and Workflow Language 


## Exercise 8: Software Installation, Upkeep & More
